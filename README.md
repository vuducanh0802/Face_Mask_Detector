# Face_Mask_Detector

## INTRO ##
**Face mask detector using OpenCV, Mediapipe, Tensorflow and Flask**
- This is my project in Year 1 during my time at university, while COVID-19 is spreading. This detector is used to
  - Detect face masks in images
  - Detect face masks in video
  - Detect face masks in real-time video streams
  - Detect fake mask by covering mouth and nose by hand
- Solution:
  - Detecting faces in images/video
  - Extracting each individual face
  - Applying our face mask classifier
  
 ## TECHSTACK/FRAMEWORK USED ##
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Flask
- Caffe-based face detector
- MobileNetV2

## INSTALLATION AND RUNNING ##
1. Clone the repo
2. Use the package manager pip to install package

    `pip install -r requirement.txt`
 
3. Open source code and read how to run

## RESULT ##

## FEATURES ##
- Using OpenCV is detect blobs
- Using Mediapipe to detect hand, a problem of covering face by hand, making a lot of noise to the prediction is addressed
- Build web demo using Flask

## WORKING ON ##
- Dealing with many people in a frame
